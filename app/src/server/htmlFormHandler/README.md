# Form Handlers

Form handlers process JavaScript disabled HTTP requests.
Place these handlers in the same way as the URL of the request.

On success they will return a redirect response.
On error they will return a server rendered HTML (showing the user an error).

New form handlers should be added to formRouter.ts and extend `FormHandlerBase` or one of the following subclasses:

- `StandardFormHandlerBase` is the most commonly used base class for simple forms.
- `MultipleFileFormHandlerBase` is the base class for handling forms containing multipart form data with multiple documents.

## StandardFormHandlerBase

### Constructor

The constructor accepts:

- `routeInfo: RouteInfo<TParams>` the info for the route to which the form is posted
- `buttons: string[]` an array of button names for which the form handler should be used
- `store: TStore` Thee name of the redux store in which the dto is stored

### Methods

- `getDto` Method to process the form body and return a dto.
- `run` Method which takes the dto as a parameter and uses it to execute an update command and return a redirect.
- `getStoreKey` Method to return the redux store key for the dto being processed. Used to construct a FormHandlerError in case of error.
- `createValidationResult` Method to return a validation result for the dto being processed. Used to construct a FormHandlerError in case of error.
