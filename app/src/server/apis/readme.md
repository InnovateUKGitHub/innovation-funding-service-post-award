# APIs

The API layer is the HTTP/S gateway to our application.
It defines the controllers for retrieving or inserting data through an HTTPS request.

## Base Class

Each Controller is a class that inherits from `ControllerBase` defining the standard DTOs that the controller returns

`ControllerBase` is a generic abstract class which exposes methods for GET/POST/DELETE/PUT.
Some example methods are:

- getItem
- deleteItem
- putItem
- etc

These methods handle returning the response or an error to the client.
Relevant API headers should be defined here (see <code>attachmentHandler</code> as an example).
Application level headers are set in [server.ts](./src/server/server.ts)

## Routing

Express is used for routing and serving up the APIs.
APIs routes are composed of { "/api" + namespace defined in controller constructor + method endpoint }.
See express documentation for route syntax.

Example route "Get Project":

`/api /controller-namespace /method endpoint`

`/api /projects /:projectId`

## Service Layer

Logic should be avoided in the API layer as there is no framework for testing the controllers aside from integration tests.
Instead, Queries and Commands should be used, see [features](./src/server/features)

## Registering a controller

To register a controller's APIs with the express router, the route must be added to the class constructor.
The method passed as the run delegate should be added to [IApiClient, serverApis](./src/server/apis/index.ts)
and [clientApi](./src/client/apiClient.ts:5).
This defines the interface for calling the api from the client or calling the method directly from the server.
