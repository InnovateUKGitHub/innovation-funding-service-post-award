import { Meta, Story, Props, Canvas } from "@storybook/blocks";
import * as Stories from "./Label.stories";

<Meta of={Stories} />

# Label
This is a GDS Label element. The `htmlFor` attribute should always be present to link to `id` of target element
<Canvas of={Stories.StandardLabel}/>


and probably its an antipattern but we do use it to link to other text elements
