## Scenarios

### Default Buttons

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.PrimaryButton} />
</Canvas>

### Start Buttons

Start Buttons have not been implemented by IFSPA.

### Secondary Buttons

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.SecondaryButton} />
</Canvas>

### Warning Buttons

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.WarningButton} />
</Canvas>

### Disabled Buttons

Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if possible.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.DisabledButton} />
</Canvas>

### Link Buttons

Link buttons are not GOV.UK components;
They are used in IFSPA in place of a button where buttons would be "too crowded",
such as within lists of documents, where each row requires a delete button.

Do not use this component in place of a link.
Use this component when a button would suffice.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.LinkButton} />
</Canvas>
