Describe their roles.\n\nWe will review the total amount of time and cost of labour before we approve this request. The terms and conditions of the grant include compliance with these points.",
    "costGuidanceOverheads": "You may claim for no overhead costs or 20% of your labour costs without providing any further supporting documentation or calculations. Actual costs can be claimed up to a maximum of the calculated figure.\n\n\nIf you feel your overheads are higher than 20% you may calculate a value using the Innovate UK model in the spreadsheet available below. The model shows you which types of indirect costs associated with your project you may claim. For support with this option, please contact our Customer Support Service on 0300 321 4357. Any value claimed under this model will be subject to a review. This will assess the appropriateness of your claim if your grant application is successful.",
    "costGuidanceMaterials": "You can claim the costs of materials used on your project providing:\n\n*  they are not already purchased or included in the overheads\n*  they are purchased from third parties\n*  they won\u2019t have a residual/resale value at the end of your project. If they do you can claim the costs minus this value\n\nMaterials supplied by associated companies or project partners should be charged at cost.\n\nSoftware that you have purchased specifically for use during your project may be included. If you already own the software then only additional costs which are incurred and paid during your project, will be eligible. For example, installation, training or customisation.\n\nMaterial costs must be itemised to justify that they are eligible.",
    "costGuidanceSubcontracting": "You can subcontract work if you don\u2019t have the expertise in your project team. You can also subcontract if it is cheaper than developing your skills in-house.\n\nSubcontracting costs relate to work carried out by third party organisations. These organisations are not part of your project.\n\nSubcontracting is eligible providing it is justified as to why the work cannot be performed by a project partner.\n\nSubcontracting associate companies should be charged at cost.\n\nWhere possible you should select a UK based contractor. You should name the subcontractor (where known) and describe what they will be doing. You should also state where the work will be undertaken. We will look at the size of this contribution when assessing your eligibility and level of support.",
    "costGuidanceCapitalUsage": "You can claim the usage costs of capital assets you will buy for, or use on, your project.\n\nYou will need to calculate a \u2018usage\u2019 value for each item. You can do this by deducting its expected value from its original price at the end of your project. If you owned the equipment before the project started then you should use its net present value.\n\nThis value is then multiplied by the amount, in percentages, that is used during the project. This final value represents the eligible cost to your project.",
    "costGuidanceTravelAndSubs": "Include all travel and subsistence costs that relate to this project. Be specific and add each item separately.\n\nYou can claim reasonable travel and subsistence costs for those individuals identified in the labour table. Costs must be necessary and be solely for the progression of your project.\n\nTravel costs must be at economy travel only. State the reason for travel, number of people travelling, mode of transport, cost per trip and number of trips.\n\nProvide full details and the purpose for any subsistence expenditure, including the number of staff involved.",
    "costGuidanceOtherCosts": "This category can be used for any direct project costs which are not covered in the other categories. Examples of other costs include:\n\n#### Workshop/laboratory usage charge outs\nCosts relating to workshops or laboratories that can be identified specifically as directly attributable to the project can be claimed in this section.\n\nYou should provide details of how the workshop or laboratory charge out rates are calculated per hour/day. This can include specific labour (such as staff permanently in place to maintain and run the workshop or laboratory and not considered project specific), rent, rates, maintenance and equipment calibration costs. These should form the overall costs together with the available operational hours to inform the hourly/daily charge out rates. Each workshop or laboratory will need to be supported with actual usage data to claim costs.\n\n#### Training costs\nThese costs are eligible where they are specific to and necessary for your project. We may consider support for management training specific to your project but will not support ongoing training.\n\n#### Preparation of technical reports\nProject costs related to technical reports may be eligible for example where the main aim of your project is the support of standards or technology transfer. You should show how this report is above and beyond what good project management would produce.\n\n#### Market assessment\nThere is some scope for support of market assessment studies to help understand how your project results are applicable to the intended market. Market research as a promotional tool is ineligible.\n\n#### Licensing in new technologies\nWe may consider support where we deem it makes sense to do so, for example, to avoid \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019. If imported technology makes up a large part of your project (which is technology valued at more than £100,000) then we expect the development of that technology as part of your project.\n\n#### Patent filing costs for new intellectual property (IP)\nIP costs generated by your project are eligible. This cost is allowable for SMEs up to a limit of £7,500 per partner. These should not include legal costs relating to the filing of trademark related expenditure as these are considered to be marketing/exploitation costs and therefore ineligible.\n\nRegulatory compliance costs are eligible if necessary to carry out your project. Project audit and accountancy feeds are not eligible.",
