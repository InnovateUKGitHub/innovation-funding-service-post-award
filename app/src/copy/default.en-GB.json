You can do this by deducting its expected value from its original price at the end of your project. If you owned the equipment before the project started then you should use its net present value.\n\nThis value is then multiplied by the amount, in percentages, that is used during the project. This final value represents the eligible cost to your project.",
    "costGuidanceTravelAndSubs": "Include all travel and subsistence costs that relate to this project. Be specific and add each item separately.\n\nYou can claim reasonable travel and subsistence costs for those individuals identified in the labour table. Costs must be necessary and be solely for the progression of your project.\n\nTravel costs must be at economy travel only. State the reason for travel, number of people travelling, mode of transport, cost per trip and number of trips.\n\nProvide full details and the purpose for any subsistence expenditure, including the number of staff involved.",
    "costGuidanceOtherCosts": "This category can be used for any direct project costs which are not covered in the other categories. Examples of other costs include:\n\n#### Workshop/laboratory usage charge outs\nCosts relating to workshops or laboratories that can be identified specifically as directly attributable to the project can be claimed in this section.\n\nYou should provide details of how the workshop or laboratory charge out rates are calculated per hour/day. This can include specific labour (such as staff permanently in place to maintain and run the workshop or laboratory and not considered project specific), rent, rates, maintenance and equipment calibration costs. These should form the overall costs together with the available operational hours to inform the hourly/daily charge out rates. Each workshop or laboratory will need to be supported with actual usage data to claim costs.\n\n#### Training costs\nThese costs are eligible where they are specific to and necessary for your project. We may consider support for management training specific to your project but will not support ongoing training.\n\n#### Preparation of technical reports\nProject costs related to technical reports may be eligible for example where the main aim of your project is the support of standards or technology transfer. You should show how this report is above and beyond what good project management would produce.\n\n#### Market assessment\nThere is some scope for support of market assessment studies to help understand how your project results are applicable to the intended market. Market research as a promotional tool is ineligible.\n\n#### Licensing in new technologies\nWe may consider support where we deem it makes sense to do so, for example, to avoid \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019. If imported technology makes up a large part of your project (which is technology valued at more than £100,000) then we expect the development of that technology as part of your project.\n\n#### Patent filing costs for new intellectual property (IP)\nIP costs generated by your project are eligible. This cost is allowable for SMEs up to a limit of £7,500 per partner. These should not include legal costs relating to the filing of trademark related expenditure as these are considered to be marketing/exploitation costs and therefore ineligible.\n\nRegulatory compliance costs are eligible if necessary to carry out your project. Project audit and accountancy feeds are not eligible.",
